## About Me

I am a final-year master’s student in cyberspace security at Xidian University, advised by Prof. Xiaoyu Zhang. I obtained my bachelor’s degree in cyberspace security at Xidian University in 2023.

## Research Interests

- **AI Copyright and Privacy Protection**
  Model and dataset watermarking, verifiable machine unlearning.
- **LLM Security and Attacks**
  Adversarial robustness of large language models, with focus on poisoning attacks, backdoor attacks, jailbreak attacks, and safety alignment.
